            Set up a crypto wallet with access to the Base network. Coinbase
            Wallet is recommended. If you are using another wallet such as
            MetaMask, follow these steps to connect to Base.

          <br />
          <li>
            Send Ethereum (ETH) to your wallet on the Base network, or send to
            your wallet via the Ethereum network then bridge to Base using
            Coinbase Wallet’s in-wallet bridge, Orbiter or Synapse.

            Head to LlamaSwap with this link that has an ETH to $BENSON swap
            preloaded. LlamaSwap is an aggregator that swaps via multiple sites
            at once, giving you the best price. Make sure your wallet is
            connected on the Base network.
